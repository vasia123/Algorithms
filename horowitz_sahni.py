''' Performs, iteratively, the Horowitz-Sahni algorithms for 0-1 KP problem.
    Tries to add as much elements to the set as possible according to their
    scaled value ("forward move") and then, when it funds a critical element 
    (i.e. one that cannot be added to the knapsack) estimates an upper bound
    (in particular Dantzig's upper bound) for the maximum value that is possible
    to get with the current elements included in the solution:
    if this bound is lower than the best value obtained so far, prunes the
    recursion and perform a backtracking move, looking for the closest '1'
    in the subset bit mask (if it exists), and removing the corresponding
    element from the knapsack.
    To improve performance, some features of the Martello-Toth algorithm are 
    added (for instance a tighter bound than Danzing's is computed).
    
    @param p:   List of elements' values;
    @param w:   List of elements' weights;
    @param c:   Total capacity of the knapsack;
    @return:    A tuple with 3 elements:
                1)    The best value found for the knapsack (the solution
                      of the problem);
                2)    The total weight of the solution;
                3)    A bitmask identifying the elements belonging to the
                      solution.
